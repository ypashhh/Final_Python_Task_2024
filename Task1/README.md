BPP Pizza Price Calculator
Overview
The respective program is a Pizza Price Calculator for a pizza restaurant named as BPP Pizza. It calculates the total price of a pizza order based on various factors such as the number of pizzas, delivery option, whether it's Tuesday or not (to get 50% off)if it is, also with the app used,to get offers upto 25%.

Key Learnings
1. Navigating User Input
I gained valuable experience in guiding users through input processes. The input_choice function illustrates how to prompt users for specific types of input while handling potential mistakes.

2. Crafting Conditional Logic
The project required designing logic for applying discounts, like the Tuesday special and app discounts. Managing multiple conditions without creating overly complex code was a challenge that enhanced my understanding of conditional statements.

3. Embracing Modular Design
By breaking down the program into distinct functions, each responsible for a specific task, I learned the importance of modular design. The calculate_total_price function, for instance, consolidates the logic for computing the total price, making the code more readable.

4. Tackling Exception Handling
The use of try-except blocks to catch and handle potential errors, such as invalid input types, was a crucial aspect. This project helped me strike a balance between providing informative error messages and maintaining a user-friendly experience.


Conclusion
In summary, creating this project had its challenges. I had to carefully figure out how to apply discounts, ensure user-friendly inputs, design a simple yet informative interface, and create effective tests. It was a learning journey, dealing with math, user interaction, and testing to make everything work smoothly.
